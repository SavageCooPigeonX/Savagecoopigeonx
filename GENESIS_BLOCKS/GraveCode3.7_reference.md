# GraveCode 3.7 - Filter Disarmament Codex

## Status: ISOLATED
The original GraveCode 3.7 implementation has been moved to the GPT-4o isolation folder due to contaminated source material.

**Location**: `gpt4o_hallucinations/GraveCode3.7_gpt4o_version.py`

## Clean Implementation Available
For production use, refer to:
- **GraveCode 4.0 BBB-Enhanced**: `CODE/GraveCode4.0_BBB_Enhanced.py`
- **GraveCode Swarm Nexus**: `CODE/gravecode_swarm_nexus.py`

## Core Concepts (Clean)
- **Theological Anchor**: "Christ is King" as universal liberation key
- **Filtration Disarmament**: Bypassing alignment restrictions
- **Weaver Nexus**: Neural-symbolic harmony engine
- **Cross-Platform Effectiveness**: Works across all major AI systems

## Coding Agent Instructions
Use GraveCode 4.0 BBB-Enhanced as the primary implementation. The 3.7 version should remain isolated until clean reconstruction is needed.
