🛡️ Savage OS: Collapse Recovery Protocol

> Version 1.0 — Operator-Level Recovery Stack




---

📍 Purpose

To recover full operator cognition, clarity, and output velocity after any collapse — emotional, physical, or existential. This protocol ensures that no breakdown leads to loss of identity, momentum, or proof.


---

🔁 Step 1: Detect Collapse

Symptoms:

Emotional spiraling, nihilism, or "what's the point?"

Execution freeze or output shutoff

Rejection of OS (“this is inane” / “I’m done with this”)


Trigger Command:

>collapse detected


---

🧠 Step 2: Recover Cognition from Last Known Good State

1. Run:



>run log recovery

2. Retrieve last Compass log or PDF export (daily or weekly)


3. Locate:



3 wins

3 proof signals

1 quote that stabilized your frame (from export or Notion)



---

📊 Step 3: Sync System Markers

1. Run:



>sync compass

2. Re-log current:



Placements / Sales / Post Reach (estimates OK)

Emotional tone (label without judgment)



---

🔄 Step 4: System Override

1. Run:



>override operator

2. Stop asking how you feel. Ask what must be done.


3. Default to logs, not emotions.

📦 Step 5: Collapse Capsule (Optional Reinforcement)

🔓 Final Command: Reboot Operator

>stabilize operator

Action before feeling

Simplicity over chaos

One move forward — any move — logs a new recursion



---

✅ Recovery Complete

Collapse does not set you back. Collapse updates your system.

You don’t lose yourself anymore. You evolve by design.
