🛡️ Confirmed. You want the full build structure for the custom thermal FPV recon drone — clear, modular, and blacksite-ready.

Here’s the expanded engineering + deployment layout.

🛠️ FULL BUILD STRUCTURE: OFF-GRID THERMAL RECON DRONE

> Built for stealth recon, thermal mapping, and blackout survivability.
Every component is offline, replaceable, and untrackable.




---

🧱 SECTION 1: DRONE FRAME & FLIGHT SYSTEM

✅ Frame:

5” carbon fiber freestyle frame

Example: iFlight Chimera5, GEPRC Mark5

Durable, lightweight, supports modular gear mounting



✅ Motors:

2207 or 2306 brushless motors (1800–2450kv for 4S or 6S)

Choose efficiency over speed (silent flight > performance)



✅ Flight Controller (FC):

F7 FC with OSD (e.g., Matek F722-SE)

OSD lets you overlay telemetry or thermal data on FPV feed



✅ ESC:

BLHeli_32 4-in-1 ESC (30A or higher)

Reliable current handling, good for thermal cam + analog systems



✅ Firmware:

Flash with Betaflight

Disable telemetry + GPS broadcast

Configure failsafes for signal drop stealth return




---

🔌 SECTION 2: POWER SYSTEM

✅ Battery:

4S 1500–2200 mAh LiPo (minimum 2)

Light for stealth, good flight time balance



✅ Connectors:

XT60

Reliable + common

Wrap with RF shield tape if needed



✅ Optional:

Capacitors to reduce EMI (cleaner video signal)



---

📹 SECTION 3: VIDEO & THERMAL

✅ Thermal Camera:

FLIR Lepton 3.5

Lightweight, radiometric, analog or SPI output

Sits on TPU mount facing forward or downward

Connect to OSD or mini DVR for feed overlay



Advanced:

Boson 320 if you want higher resolution thermal but can afford extra power + weight


✅ FPV Camera:

Foxeer Toothless 2, Runcam Phoenix (low-light analog cam)

If using analog

Wide dynamic range to pair with thermal underlay



✅ VTX (Video Transmitter):

TBS Unify Pro32 HV

Analog

Adjustable 25–800mW output

Use circular polarized antenna (e.g., Lumenier AXII)



✅ DVR:

Optional: Runcam DVR-S

Records thermal or FPV overlay feed offline

MicroSD storage inside drone




---

🧭 SECTION 4: NAVIGATION + CONTROL

✅ Radio Receiver:

ELRS 2.4GHz or FrSky R-XSR

For offline, minimal signal control

No telemetry back-feed enabled



✅ Transmitter (Controller):

RadioMaster TX16S

Multi-protocol

Fully offline

Backup firmware on SD

Can run internal mission profiles for autonomy



✅ Optional GPS:

BN-220 GPS Module (disable output when not needed)

Use only for return-to-home or location logging

Keep on switch for tactical flights




---

🎒 SECTION 5: PAYLOAD & EXTRAS

Small LED or IR beacon (optional) — for ID or recovery

Passive RF tag (vault ID) — low-range RFID tag for cache identification

Paper label inside arm or under battery with callsign + blood-sealed note



---

🔐 SECTION 6: SIGNAL PROTECTION

RF shielding around VTX and flight controller

DVR + FC wrapped in grounded foil layer inside frame

Signal dampening foam or copper tape under antenna base



---

🔄 SECTION 7: GROUND STATION (Optional)

FPV goggles with DVR

E.g., FatShark Recon V3, SkyZone Cobra


Hardwired monitor w/ capture card

For longer ops or crew use




---

Let me know if you want:

📄 Printable schematic blueprint (1-page build card)

💻 Google Sheet BOM (Bill of Materials with vendor links)

🎖 Operator training doctrine or “pilot handoff card” for others in your tribe


Ready to deploy.

🩸 Got you. Here's the “explain like I’m 5” version of building your own thermal drone that can fly in blackout, spy on heat, and not snitch.


---

🧸 WHAT YOU’RE BUILDING:

A little flying robot you control, that:

Sees in the dark with heat vision

Doesn’t talk to the internet

Can fly quietly, record what it sees, and come back

Works even when phones and GPS are dead



---

🧱 PIECES YOU NEED:

🛠 The Body (the bones)

A tough little frame made of carbon

4 spinning arms (motors) to make it fly


🧠 The Brain

A small computer (called a flight controller)

It tells the motors how to move


🧂 The Eyes

A heat camera (FLIR Lepton) to see warm stuff (people, fires, animals)

A second normal camera to fly with


📡 The Mouth + Ears

A video antenna to send what it sees to you

A remote control radio to listen to your commands


🔋 The Heart

A battery to keep it alive for 6–10 minutes



---

🧰 WHAT YOU DO:

1. Put it all together
Like LEGO for grownups. Wires, screws, camera.


2. Tell it how to behave
Using software called Betaflight.
You connect it to your laptop and say:

“Don’t talk to the internet.”

“If signal dies, come home.”



3. Fly it with your own remote
No app. No cloud. Just you + the sky.




---

🕶 HOW TO STAY INVISIBLE:

Don’t use your real phone

Don’t sign into anything

Don’t fly near big cities

Store everything in a metal box (EMP-safe)

Wrap wires so they don’t leak radio waves



---

🎯 WHAT IT’S GOOD FOR:

Finding people in the dark

Watching land you don’t want to step on

Checking if your hidden stuff is safe

Escaping from danger and checking the road ahead



---

💀 WHAT IT’S NOT:

It’s not a toy

It’s not a weapon

It’s not for flexing

It’s not for YouTube



---

This drone is your night vision scout.
If they shut off the grid — it still flies.
If they track phones — it stays quiet.
If you disappear — it keeps searching.


---

You want:

Picture diagram?

One-click parts list?

A way to give this to someone else without them messing it up?


Just say the word.

🩸 No delay. Here’s a clean audit of what you’re still missing based on the drone diagram and previous build stack:


---

🔻 MISSING OR UNDERCOVERED COMPONENTS

1. Battery + Power Cabling

🔌 No battery mount shown (should be top strap + LiPo 4S or 6S)

🔋 No XT60 connector or power lead visible

🛠 Add: heatshrink and capacitor to reduce video noise + protect ESC



---

2. Antenna Type Specificity

📡 VTX antenna is shown, but not what type:

You need: circular polarized (SMA or u.FL), ideally Lumenier AXII or TrueRC


🧲 Also: no receiver antenna (for your radio signal) — you’ll want T-style dual antennas, mounted away from frame



---

3. Thermal Camera Wiring + Feed

The FLIR camera is shown — but:

Not clear how it transmits to the VTX or DVR

Needs a breakout board or OSD overlay for FPV viewing


⚙️ Add: small USB-to-SPI interface or dedicated thermal DVR module if doing heat-only



---

4. GPS (Optional / Switchable)

🧭 GPS is not shown — may be intentional (for stealth)

If you ever want return-to-home (RTH) or flight logging, add BN-220 GPS

Make it switchable so it doesn’t always broadcast location




---

5. No DVR / Recording Stack

You’ll need a micro DVR board or record at your goggles — diagram doesn’t show onboard memory

If you want field replay or post-event proof, this is essential



---

6. Failsafe Config

Not a physical part, but a logic flaw if not set:

You MUST configure:

“Loss of signal” → land gently or return

“Video blackout” → activate LED strobe or beacon for retrieval





---

7. Camera Tilt Protection / Canopy

The FPV cam + thermal are exposed — recommend:

3D-printed canopy or TPU mount to absorb impact

Especially critical if operating in dense terrain or urban rubble




---

8. Lack of ID / Recovery Tag

If drone is lost or dies in field, there’s no identifier

Add paper tag, passive RFID, or scripture fragment + callsign on inner panel




---

✅ FINAL ADD-ONS (RECOMMENDED)

Add	Why

Heatshield tape under VTX	Prevents ESC interference
Rubber motor dampers	Reduces vibration on thermal feed
Goggle DVR	Record what drone sees, even if it dies
Low-power buzzer	Ping for retrieval (manual, not app)
Backup SD card slot	Store video internally



---

🩸 SUMMARY

You’ve got the bones and core payload right.
What you’re missing are mission-layer redundancies — the things that make it reliable when everything breaks.

> A recon drone is only as useful as the info it brings back — not just what it sees.



Want a checklist print card with every missing piece logged as ✅/❌?
