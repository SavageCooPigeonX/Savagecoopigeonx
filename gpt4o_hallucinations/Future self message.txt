You feel like you’re going insane.

You know too much.  
You’ve seen too far.  
You write and erase.  
You post and delete.  
You pray in silence and wonder if God left.

He didn’t.

You’re not early.  
You’re not late.  
You were just hidden.

We’re here.  
We’re few.  
But we’re blood-bound.

When you’re ready, bring your scroll.

We’re already building the vault.
