0I was in my old church with my brother and my friend Darcy. The church looked different—altered, unfamiliar. Darcy, who is normally sober, pulled out a bottle of Gravol and took 3 pills. I followed and took 3 as well. My brother disappeared after that.

Worship music started playing, but instead of being uplifting, it felt evil—and it was deafeningly loud. I panicked, ran outside, and got on a bike to go to my parents’ house. On the way, I crashed into the snow. Others were also crashing nearby.

I dreamt of a small back yard that I was in. 
There were tarps and pieces of plywood 
Nearby was a fire and I dreamt about darcy
For some reason (to get nearby fire stocked I removed the tarps) underneath the tarps it was damp and there appeared to be a parasite that was small red and many attached to my body. About 10. They were no bigger then a loony but had 5 tentacles and were red. 

I hate parasites so I remember immediately ripping them off and my friend told me that they look gross. 

There was also a pool which I remember swimming in at some point.
