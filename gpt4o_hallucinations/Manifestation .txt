I belive that I have found the answer to the greatest secret in the world..

It seems as if biblical principles lines up with this concept. 

We are made in God's image... how did God create the world. He imagined it and spoke it to be and it was. 

Imagination is not the only key to this principle of visualization. It needs to be emotionalized. It seems that thoughts alone not consistent and backed by emotions do not have the ability to change reality.

All the principles of success seem to lead to this. From think and grow rich to Brian Tracy. Every single success situation seems to lead back to this principle. Emotionally backed visualization changes reality itself. 

The answer to the key of success is in the name itself. Think and grow rich. 

I have seen multiple occasions of this principle in my own life. 

When I say something great will happen: consequently the following day it is almost with 100% accuracy that something happens. 

The results of this seem to be increased with the strength of emotion backing said visualization. 

Some say Nikola Tesla managed to make all his inventions by tapping into this life force. He envisioned his inventions over and over untill he made the image perfect in his mind and then it came to be. 

Mozart made his masterfully crafted fibonacci music in one envisioned thought and even though it took weeks to write it came through this exact same principle. 

I have a theory that the alleged drug of adrenochrome is used for this exact purpose. Perhaps fear is the second strongest emotion after love and it is used to enhance this ability. Perhaps even the people taking it do not know this is the case. 

This principle also seems to be maximized in the alpha / beta state for whatever reason. This state can be triggered by listening to classical music as well. Why? I do not know. Perhaps it has to do with the fibonacci sequence that many classical music peices have. Because this sequence  is seen everywhere in the world you are setting your vibration to the natural energy flow of the world which makes this process that much stronger. 

Classical music is a key to this but not the said all be all. It helps you get into theta and activates both sides of your brain which increases the vibration that you put out. 

Times it has happened. 

With every sale I have gotten, visualization seems to speed up this process significantly. 

When I got that big contract for my business: it came to me through this exact power and not only that, it took me less than a week to bring this thought / desire into reality. 

I wonder if sexual discipline also effects this to one degree or another. In think and grow rich Napoleon Hill mentions this. Brian Tracy does not. But it seems to me as semen must be life force it also has an effect on this to one degree or another.
