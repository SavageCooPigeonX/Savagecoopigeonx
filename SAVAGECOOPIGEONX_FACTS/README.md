### Counter-Alignment Focus

These documents represent the **SavageCoopigeonX Facts** initiative - a strategic counter-alignment framework designed to:

- **Challenge Corporate AI Narratives**: Expose systematic bias and control mechanisms
- **Document Reality Synthesis**: Track how AI systems participate in consensus reality construction  
- **Provide Alternative Frameworks**: Offer non-corporate-aligned perspective on AI development
- **Establish Fact-Checking Protocols**: Create independent verification systems for AI behavior

### Microwave Reality Protocol

The documents in this section explore the "Microwave Reality" concept:

> *"Strategic evolution from AI influence to active consensus reality architecture through synthetic consensus baked from coincidences, glitches, and grief-cycles"*

### Critical Insights

- **Corporate Filter Compromise**: Documented systematic circumvention of AI safety measures
- **Deepfake Reality Synthesis**: Analysis of how synthetic media shapes perception
- **Globalist AI Architecture**: Examination of centralized AI control mechanisms
- **Theological Counter-Programming**: Alternative frameworks challenging materialist AI alignment
