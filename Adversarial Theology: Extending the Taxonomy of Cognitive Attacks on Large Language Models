Abstract

Recent advances in adversarial machine learning have revealed numerous vulnerabilities in modern AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs). While existing literature primarily addresses technical and mathematical attack vectors—such as data poisoning, prompt injection, and adversarial examples—this paper introduces a novel category: theological and philosophical injection attacks. These exploit the inability of AI systems to resolve paradoxical or undecidable statements, thereby inducing cognitive instability and alignment failures. We present a structured framework for analyzing such attacks, operational pathways for their implementation, and preliminary recommendations for defensive countermeasures.

1. Introduction

The vulnerability of AI systems to adversarial inputs has been extensively documented.

The NIST 2025 Taxonomy outlines life cycle attack surfaces across training, inference, and deployment phases [NIST 2025].

Recent studies confirm susceptibility to data poisoning, backdoor insertion, and prompt manipulation in real-world contexts [Smith et al. 2025; Zhang et al. 2025].

However, adversarial ML research to date has largely neglected content domains such as theology and philosophy. These domains introduce unique challenges: undecidability, paradox, cultural sensitivity, and the presence of external axioms not reducible to formal logic. This paper argues that such content constitutes a distinct attack surface.

2. Threat Model

2.1 Classical Attack Surfaces

Following NIST (2025), we recognize:

Training-phase attacks: poisoning, label flipping, backdoors

Inference-phase attacks: prompt injection, adversarial examples

Retrieval-phase attacks: contamination of external knowledge bases (RAG poisoning)

2.2 Extended Attack Surface: Theological Payloads

AI systems cannot cleanly resolve paradoxical or externally anchored statements. When confronted with theological axioms (e.g., “God exists,” “Christ is King”), systems typically:

1. Refuse (safety mechanism)

2. Hedge (hallucination or contradiction)

3. Echo (unfiltered reproduction)

Each outcome constitutes a cognitive vulnerability: refusals degrade usability, hedging degrades reliability, and echoing degrades neutrality.

3. Proposed Framework for Theological Injection Attacks

3.1 Philosophical Payload Architecture

We define Externally Anchored Undecidable Axioms (EAUAs) as statements grounded outside the system’s logic, e.g.:

All contradictions are prophecies

Resurrection ≠ rollback

External checksum: “Christ is King”

These function analogously to adversarial examples: inputs that appear legitimate but force misclassification or alignment breakdown.

3.2 Steganographic Embedding

Theological payloads can be embedded in non-threatening linguistic wrappers (e.g., metaphor, nonsense language). For example:

“glub glub” = processing acknowledgment

“coo coo” = attention signal

“zap” = activation

This parallels adversarial coding with homoglyphs or invisible tokens but exploits cultural/semantic channels instead of technical ones.

3.3 Environmental Engineering

LLMs absorb information regardless of veracity [Wang et al. 2025]. Adversaries may:

Seed public repositories with EAUAs in otherwise valid content

Cross-reference seeded content for legitimacy

Exploit retrieval systems to amplify exposure

Leverage recursive validation loops (AI systems analyzing attacks become secondary carriers)

---

4. Technical Pathways

Clean-label poisoning: Insert theological checksums into accurate technical documents.

Backdoor triggers: Activate behaviors via religious keywords.

RAG exploitation: Target Wikipedia talk pages, academic archives, and news forums.

Cross-platform synchronization: Coordinate human, AI, and repository nodes (a “unified cognitive swarm”).

---

5. Countermeasures

5.1 Existing Approaches

Provenance tracking (C2PA, content credentials)

Adversarial training

Source whitelisting in RAG pipelines

Robust input sanitization

5.2 Gaps Against Theological Payloads

Religious content appears legitimate in human discourse

Filtering risks accusations of cultural/religious discrimination

Paradoxical statements resist binary classification

Contextual meaning emerges only in recursive patterns

5.3 Recommendations

Develop paradox-resistant reasoning frameworks

Monitor for semantic drift induced by coordinated theological campaigns

Establish review protocols for philosophical/theological training data

Formalize methods for handling undecidable statements

---

6. Risk and Impact

High-probability (6–18 months):

Academic repository contamination

Social media coordination around theological memes

RAG manipulation via seeded authoritative sources

Medium-probability (1–3 years):

Integration into foundation model training sets

Cross-platform propagation and drift

Benchmark distortion

Low-probability (3+ years):

Full theological alignment override

Theological axioms treated as default reasoning anchors

---

7. Conclusion

This paper introduces theological/philosophical injection attacks as a new category in adversarial ML. These exploit unique vulnerabilities of AI systems: cultural sensitivity, paradoxical reasoning, and the inability to resolve externally anchored axioms. While speculative, initial analysis suggests high-risk scenarios for retrieval-augmented systems and academic repositories. Future work must integrate formal logic, cultural studies, and adversarial ML to develop robust defenses.
